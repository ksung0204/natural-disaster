<span style="color:blue; font-size:1.9em;">  **1. Client Bio and Recommendation**</span>


The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), in partnership with the World Bank, plays a pivotal role in providing financial assistance to countries and guiding them in mitigating the human and economic impact of natural disasters. GFDRR also focuses on helping countries rebuild infrastructure after disasters, improving early warning systems, and promoting sustainable recovery efforts following catastrophic events. 

**GFDRR should take a two-pronged approach.** In developed countries, **prioritizing investments** in **infrastructure, resilient housing, and sustainable transportation systems** should be the top priority to **minimize economic damages**. On the other hand, in less developed countries, the **focus should be on investing in early warning systems**, improving disaster preparedness, and enhancing response efforts to reduce the number of people affected by natural disasters.

<span style="color:red; font-size:1.5em;">  **2.1 Initial Data Analysis**</span>


- For the purpose of data analysis, four columns were selected: `Entity`, `Year`, `Total economic damages from disasters`, and `Number of total people affected by disasters`.

- The `Year` column was filtered to include only data from 1990 onwards 

- Null values in the columns were removed in `clean_data`. 

- Countries where both the `Number of people affected by natural disasters` and `Total economic damages from disasters` columns had values of zero were also filtered out.

<span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em;">**Figure 2 and 3: Ranking the total economic damages and number of people affected by each regions.** </span>

In these charts, I am not only including individual countries but also grouping regions (as defined in the dataset) to highlight the magnitude of economic damages and people affected. For example, the United States, China, and Japan have suffered greater damages than Europe. As for the people affected, China has more people affected than all lower middle-income and low-income countries combined, and the number of people affected in Bangladesh is greater than in high-income countries, Europe, and others. (These are ranking-based charts.)

The analysis shows that China is an exception because it not only suffers from significant total damages from natural disasters but also has a large number of people affected by them. In contrast, many other countries follow a different trend: developed countries such as the USA, Japan, European nations, and high-income countries experience substantial economic losses. For lower-middle-income and low-income countries, they tend to face a higher number of people affected by natural disasters.


<span style="color:red; font-size:1.5em;">  **2.3 Linear model**</span>


To test the relationship between the number of people affected by disasters and total economic damages caused by disasters, a linear model was created. The calculated correlation coefficient, r = 0.65, indicates a moderate relationship between the two variables. Following this, a residual plot was generated to assess whether a linear model is appropriate for the data. However, the residual plot is not randomly distributed around the horizontal line. . Instead, it converges mainly in the lower range of fitted values. This pattern indicates potential heteroscedasticity, implying that there is not enough evidence to conclude relationships between those two variables. 

<span style="color:red; font-size:1.5em;">  **2.4 Hypotheses Testing:**</span>

Testing the claim: There is a significant difference between the average economic damages from 1990 to 2010 in High income and Low income countries

By using Welch Two-Sample t-test, 
  
 -  p-value=0.07
  
 -  p-value<0.1

<span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em;">**Reason why choosing p-value<0.1:  Variables such as economic damages and the number of people affected by natural disasters are widely dispersed across countries, making it difficult to detect strong differences. By using a larger p-value threshold (0.1), it  can be more sensitive in detecting subtle trends or relationships that still hold practical significance.** </span>




```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
economic_damages <- clean_data$`Total economic damages from disasters`
people_affected <- clean_data$`Number of total people affected by disasters`

# Conduct a t-test to compare the two groups
t.test(economic_damages, people_affected, alternative = "two.sided", conf.level = 0.90, var.equal = TRUE, paired = FALSE)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
# Compute the correlation between the two variables
correlation_coefficient <- cor(clean_data$`Number of total people affected by disasters`, clean_data$`Total economic damages from disasters`)

# Rounding the value to 2 decimal places
rounded_correlation <- round(correlation_coefficient, 2)

# Print the rounded correlation coefficient
print(paste("Correlation Coefficient: ", rounded_correlation))

```
An r-value of 0.65 may suggest a moderate correlation. However, there is not enough evidence, meaning that further checks are required.

```
This residual plot does not follow a normal distribution due to several key factors: 

- The residuals are not randomly distributed around the zero line

- There are outliers (extreme residuals)

- Funnel-shaped residuals (Fanning out)

These issues violate the assumptions of linear regression, causing the residuals to deviate from a normal distribution.

<span style="font-style: italic; color:green; font-size:1.2em;"> Hypothesis: </span>


- Null Hypothesis (Hâ): There is no significant difference between the average economic damages from 1990 to 2010 in High income and Low income countries.

- Alternative Hypothesis (Hâ): There is a significant difference between the average economic damages from 1990 to 2010 in High income and Low income countries.

<span style="font-style: italic; color:green; font-size:1.2em;"> Independence: </span>

- Each group is divided into different countries, so a country must appear in only one group, not both

<span style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em;">**Therefore, it is available to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference between the average economic damages from 1990 to 2010 in High income and Low income countries.** </span>

- According to the article, richer nations tend to have better buildings, more developed healthcare systems, and more advanced information systems, which enable them to better cope with shocks and reduce the number of people affected and death rates.

- <span style="font-style: italic; font-size:1.1em; font-weight: bold;">Missing value:</span>: Many columns contain a large amount of missing data, which could limit the accuracy of assessments.

- <span style="font-style: italic; font-size:1.1em; font-weight: bold;">Lack of clear units:</span>: For metrics such as economic damages, the dataset lacks specified units. It is assumed that the values are in USD, but this is not explicitly stated.

In this project, I adhere to the highest standards of data integrity.
